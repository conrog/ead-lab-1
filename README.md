## Project Background

The purpose of this project was to build **a new website** for an imaginary company using Bootstrap. The website was built for the Pine Copse Studio, which is a studio a family member has created. The website is fully responsive on small, medium and desktop devices.

## How to View the Website

You can view the website online [here](https://conrog.github.io/ead-lab-1/) which is made available using GitHub pages.

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
